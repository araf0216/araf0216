- 👋 Hi, I’m @spacearaf
- 👀 I’m interested in back-end programming including solving data structures and algorithms problems and making neat, functional projects. Other than that, I enjoy video games, film, comedy, and martial arts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, Flutter, and of course Git/GitHub.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source python projects in general.
- 📫 How to reach me: araf0216@gmail.com
