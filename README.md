- I have had a passion for software development since high school when I began my journey as a self-taught developer, building personal projects and learning to overcome the various issues and challenges in different programming languages and frameworks including Python and Flutter.
- Currently pursuing Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at University of South Florida. Gaining exposure and experience to previously unfamiliar languages and technologies including Embedded Arduino C++ programming and a proficiency in C.
- Enjoy competing in hackathon competitions and learning from others' experience and perspectives as well as grinding Leetcode problems to continuously develop and sharpen my problem-solving skills as well as enhancing my conceptual understanding of data structures and algorithms.
