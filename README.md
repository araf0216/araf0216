- Driven by a passion for software development since high school when I began my journey as a self-taught developer, building personal projects and learning to problem-solve, utilizing various programming languages and frameworks such as Python, JS, PHP, and Flutter.

- Currently pursuing Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at University of South Florida. Gaining exposure and experience to previously unfamiliar technologies including Embedded Arduino C++ programming and a proficiency in C.

- Enjoy competing in hackathons and learning from others' experience and perspectives as well as grinding Leetcode problems to continuously enhance and sharpen my problem-solving skills as well as my conceptual understanding of data structures and algorithms.
