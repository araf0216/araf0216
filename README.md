- 👋 Hi, I’m @spacearaf
- 👀 I’m interested in back-end programming including solving data structures and algorithms problems as well as working on actual projects. Other than that, I like video games, film, and martial arts.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, Flutter, and of course Git/GitHub.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source python projects in general.
- 📫 How to reach me: spacebuttonaraf@gmail.com
